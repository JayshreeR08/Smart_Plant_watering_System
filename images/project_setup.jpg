#About the Project Images

## Hardware Setup
The image below shows the complete hardware setup of the Smart Plant Watering System.

It includes:
- ESP32 development board
- Soil moisture sensor inserted into the plant pot
- Relay module for pump control
- Mini water pump placed in a water container
- External power supply for the pump

The ESP32 reads moisture values from the sensor and controls the relay module to turn the water pump ON or OFF automatically based on soil moisture level.
